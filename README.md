## Project Description

Driven Eats is a sleek Front-End food delivery app designed to offer users a simple and intuitive ordering experience. 
The app allows users to select any combination of three menu items (such as an entr√©e, beverage, and dessert), 
providing a clear and dynamic user interface that updates in real-time.

Once a valid combination of items is selected, the "Place Order" button turns green and becomes clickable, 
indicating that the user can proceed with their order. After clicking the button, the app automatically calculates the total price of the selected items 
and conveniently redirects the user to a WhatsApp chat to finalize their order directly with me, streamlining the process.
